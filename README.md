## Description
>Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of the other's various ships. A paper and pencil version of the game dates back to World War I, but most people are familiar with the game through the plastic board game that was first marketed by the Milton Bradley Company in 1967. Since then, the game has spawned various video games and smartphone app variations. Today, the board game version is produced by Hasbro, which acquired Milton Bradley in 1984. 
>
>The object of the game is to guess the location of the ships each player hides on a plastic grid containing vertical and horizontal space coordinates. Players take turns calling out row and column coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that contains a ship. 
>
>The game board each player gets has two grids. One of the grids is used by the player to "hide" the location of his own ships, while the other grid is used to record the shots fired toward the opponent and to document whether those shots were hits or misses. The goal of the game is to sink all of the opponent's ships by correctly guessing their location on the grid (Brown).
